00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,440
Hi and welcome to another
episode of the gorilla travels

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,719
we are in holguin the fourth largest
city in cuba

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,000
located in the eastern part of the
island about 500 miles from havana

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,160
the city was founded in 1545 by the
spanish officer

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,480
son isadoro de hogin

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,199


7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,359
currently we are standing on la loma de

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
la cruz which gives you an amazing
panoramic view over the city

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
the climb up this hill consists of 465
stair steps

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,160
but as you can see it's definitely worth

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
Holguin is home to the only organ factory
in cuba

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,680
this small factory produces about six
mechanical organs a year

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,320
which can be sold between 10 to 25 000
us dollars

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,079
the organ music tradition is specific to
the city and an integral part

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:13,840
of the local culture

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
if you want to experience it firsthand
swing by parque cespedes

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
on sunday mornings to hear one of the
eight professional organ groups perform

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
let's swing by now

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,640
the official name for this park is

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,200
parque carlos manuel de cespedes

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
but everyone calls it park san jose

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
named after the church you see here

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,040
iglesia de san jose

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
the park is surrounded by a couple of

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,240
art galleries a small museum
and the ministry of culture

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
the passion and enthusiasm for sports is
ingrained in the cuban culture

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
from an early age on you can find people
of all ages

28
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,600
playing in parks squares and fields like
you see here

sport of cuba

communities who proudly share in the

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
