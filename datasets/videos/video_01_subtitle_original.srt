1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,020
Welcome to London!

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,010
Our tour begins with the London Eye, Europe's
tallest observation wheel.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,000
It is the most famous scenic viewpoint in
the capital with a height of 135 meters.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,440
Starting at Big Ben that is hidden under scaffolding,
we invite you to have a ride on a double-decker

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,980
through Westminster Bridge.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
This kind of buses is a convenient way to
have a look at the city and its main sights.

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:00,280
Look at the sky: airplanes are leaving colourful trails behind them in honour of the Queen Elizabeth II birthday.

8
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,479
On this bridge, there is always a lot of tourists
and attraction points with the bagpipe among them.

9
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,000
It is one of the most ancient musical instruments
and a national instrument of Scotland.

10
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,800
Tower Bridge is a marvel of engineering.

11
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,660
With a total length of 244 meters, it opens
within a minute.

12
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,759
Even then, pedestrians could cross the river
through a special walkway.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,340
But since 1982, these walkways have been used
as a museum and a viewpoint.

14
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,560
The Tower is one of the most ancient buildings in London.

15
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,440
It is believed to be founded by William I.

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,500
For more than a thousand years history, it
had been a fortress, a palace, a treasury,

17
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,180
an armoury, the Royal Mint, a prison and an observatory.

18
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,180
In the 13th century, one of the towers served
as a menagerie with a bear that went fishing

19
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,200
in the Thames.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,180
We are in front of the Westminster Scholars War Memorial

21
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,560
and Westminster Abbey, a beautiful gothic church.

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,980
The abbey together with the Palace of Westminster
was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site

23
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,399
in 1987.

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,900
The abbey is a traditional site for the coronation
events and a burial place for the British Monarchs.

25
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,960
Feast your eyes on its courtyard surrounded
by cloister galleries.

26
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,760
Unfortunately, the main premises are prohibited
to be photographed, even with a mobile phone.

27
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,859
In front of us, there is the famous Buckingham Palace.

28
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,260
It was built as a private residence for the Duke.

29
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,779
Afterwards, it was acquired and rebuilt by
King George III

30
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,200
and It became the official residence of
the British Monarchy on the accession of Queen

31
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,079
Victoria only in 1837.

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,899
In London, there are many “wild” animals,
such as squirrels, parrots, foxes and deers

33
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,779
that are getting on well in this metropolis.

34
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,560
We were lucky to meet a squirrel in Hyde Park.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,520
In Trafalgar Square, there is the National
Gallery that is among the world’s five most

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
popular art museums.

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,600
One can visit it, like many other London museums,
free of charge.

38
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,540
On top of the 17-meters high Ludgate Hill,
there is St Paul's Cathedral.

39
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,700
It is a fifth Christian church on this site:

40
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,300
one of the previous was destroyed by the Vikings,

41
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,840
others were burnt down in a fire.

42
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,440
The present Cathedral was completed in 1708,
now it is the residence of the Bishop of London.

43
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,916
Now we are in front of Tate Modern, a museum of contemporary art,

44
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,359
and the Millennium Bridge built in honour of the third millennium.

45
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,520
It was also featured in such movies as Harry Potter, Love Actually and Black Mirror TV series.

46
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,560
Just behind HMS Belfast, the World War II-era
cruiser, you can see the highest skyscraper

47
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,400
in the UK, the Shard, rising at 309 meters.

48
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,580
Thank you for this journey made with AirPano!
