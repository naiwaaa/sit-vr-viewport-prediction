00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,840
Hi again and welcome to one of the most
classical and historic cities of Europe

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,780
founded as early as 500 years before Christ
located along the Dona River

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,470
it was home to many famous historical figures
like Mozart Freud Stalin Brahms and Strauss

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,330
We are of course in the second largest
german-speaking city in the world

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,019
Vienna let me put on some fitting music

6
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,910
In this city of music the big building
in front of you plays an important role

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,910
it's the Grand Opera House and it has
hosted many famous musicians

8
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,219
It can hold over 1,200 guests
at the same time and

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,379
as to Vienna people still love their
opera and Viennese balls

10
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,870
 it is as popular today as it was in the
19th century

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,059
another place who definitely visit
when you're into classical music

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,729
is the house where Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart lived when he was a resident here

13
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:10,920
he lived in grand style at four large
rooms two small ones

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,840
and a spacious kitchen and if we should
believe the stories of him being a party animal

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,259
he also had some epic house parties here

16
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:21,330
not far from here you will find a true

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,759
city center that all its nice shops cafes
and restaurants

18
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,640
this road that serviced the center was

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,700
once Robin or ditch used by the Roman army
army to defend the city

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,899
today is a great place to go shopping
or have lunch

21
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,569
this is the st. Stefan's church and it's
located on stations Platz

22
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:47,619
it was built in Gothic style in 1147

23
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:51,679
only to be completed in 1433

24
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,079
can you imagine taking 86 years to
build your house

25
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,830
let some willpower if you want to

26
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,080
have the best view of the city and send
one of these two towers

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,909
unfortunately we couldn't as they were
undergoing restoration

28
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,790
located near stephansplatz is this mercy

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,010
column showing the Holy Trinity
and nine angels

30
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,040
it was erected after the big play

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,269
for Black Death epidemic in 1679 please

32
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,849
spare siding on rats probably causes

33
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,840
bacteria to spread to use killing 76,000

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,519
people in the city that was about half
the population of Vienna at the time

35
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,709
 now for something brighter if you
 want to go

36
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,569
for a nice stroll through Park

37
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,849

worth a visit

38
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,980
 the local residents love to come here

39
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,260
and the national art and history museums
situated near the park

History Museum even as a well-preserved

dodo in this collection

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,620
one of the best-kept secrets of Vienna
is the st. Peter's Church tucked away on

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,409
Peters Platz it might not impress much

44
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:15,209
from the outside you could easily walk
by it without really noticing it

45
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,519
but it actually is a baroque masterpiece

46
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,629
from the inside yeah take a moment
to take it

47
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:33,930
all in Vienna had a lot and you're doing

48
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,480
World War 2 under Nazi rule the place
you are standing on once had a bomb

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,040
cellar under it in which hundreds of
Austin's were buried alive during a raid

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,920
to remind Austrians of the tragedy of

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,030
this anti-war and anti-fascist and
monument has been placed here

52
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,620
and here we are at the final destination
of our tour the Hofburg palace

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,269
it was the political heart of the Habsburg
Empire it once was the Palace of Empress

54
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,650
Elizabeth better known as

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,489
she must have walked along the square in
flamboyant dresses

56
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,909
and with long curly hair ruling her
 Empire the legend of her

57
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,579
beauty still prevails and with the

00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,820
